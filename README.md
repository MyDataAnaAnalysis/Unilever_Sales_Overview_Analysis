## Unilever Sales Overview Analysis

### Project Overview

This project centers on the analysis of Unilever's sales data, focusing on performance across multiple regions and product categories. Using Power BI, the goal is to create dynamic and interactive dashboards that offer insights into key sales metrics, including sales revenue, profit, and quantities sold. The dashboards also allow comparisons between the current year and previous years, helping to identify trends, forecast sales, and optimize inventory.

The data used is a dummy dataset meant to represent real-world sales scenarios for Unilever, enabling business intelligence professionals and stakeholders to explore actionable insights efficiently.

### Business Requirements
The primary goal of this project is to develop a Power BI dashboard that tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) for Unilever's sales. The dashboard should:

- Display sales, profit, and quantity metrics across four regions: Lagos, West, South, and North.
- Allow users to filter data by year and dynamically toggle between sales, profit, and quantity.
- Include a comparison of current year (CY) and previous year (PY) metrics, with a year-over-year (YoY) analysis for sales, profit, and quantity.
- Visualize sales trends through bar sparklines and include average lines for better trend analysis.
  
  Additional features include:
- **Sales by State:** A bubble map representing sales distribution across states, paired with a bar chart for detailed comparison.
- **KPI Table:** A tabular view of CY and PY metrics for sales, profit, and quantity, along with YoY changes.

#### Project Steps
The project followed these major steps:
1. **Requirement Gathering:** Defined the business objectives and KPIs.
2. **Data Walkthrough:** Explored the dataset to understand its structure.
3. **Data Connection:** Connected to the data source and prepared for modeling.
4. **Data Cleaning/Quality Check:** Processed and ensured data accuracy.
5. **Data Modeling:** Structured data for effective analysis.
6. **DAX Calculations:** Created dynamic calculations to meet reporting needs.
7. **Dashboard Development:** Designed the layout, created charts, and formatted reports.
8. **Insights Generation:** Derived actionable insights from the visualizations.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI:** Used for data modeling, DAX calculations, and visual reporting.
