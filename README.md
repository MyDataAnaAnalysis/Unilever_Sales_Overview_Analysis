## Unilever Sales Overview Analysis

### Project Overview

This project centers on the analysis of Unilever's sales data, focusing on performance across multiple regions and product categories. Using Power BI, the goal is to create dynamic and interactive dashboards that offer insights into key sales metrics, including sales revenue, profit, and quantities sold. The dashboards also allow comparisons between the current year and previous years, helping to identify trends, forecast sales, and optimize inventory.

The data used is a dummy dataset meant to represent real-world sales scenarios for Unilever, enabling business intelligence professionals and stakeholders to explore actionable insights efficiently.

### Business Requirements
The primary goal of this project is to develop a Power BI dashboard that tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) for Unilever's sales. The dashboard should:

- Display sales, profit, and quantity metrics across four regions: Central, East, South, and West.
 Allow users to filter data by year and dynamically toggle between sales, profit, and quantity.
 Include a comparison of current year (CY) and previous year (PY) metrics, with a year-over-year (YoY) analysis for sales, profit, and quantity.
- Visualize sales trends through bar sparklines and include average lines for better trend analysis.
